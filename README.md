# SpacePong
SpacePong game.

The basegame comes from Jaryt Bustard and can be found here: https://github.com/Jaryt/PongTutorial.

I used the game engine he made to learn how to implement a code and improve on it.
I made a settings menu using JavaFX to improve my skills in it, and I also converted the code
to use the MVC standard.
