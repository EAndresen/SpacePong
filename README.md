# SpacePong
SpacePong game.

The basegame comes from Jaryt Bustard and can be found here: https://github.com/Jaryt/PongTutorial.

I used the game engien he mades to learn how to implement code and improwe on it.
I made a settings menu using JavaFX to improve my skills in that and i also converted the code
to use the MVC standard.
